<!-- preamble: project learnings -->
After the update check, run this silently to load prior learnings for this project:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/econstack/bin/econstack-slug)"
~/.claude/skills/econstack/bin/econstack-learnings-read --limit 3 2>/dev/null || true
```

If learnings are found, apply them. When a prior learning influences a decision, note: "Prior learning applied: [key]".

**Capturing new learnings:** After completing this skill, log new insights via:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/econstack/bin/econstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"...","type":"...","key":"...","insight":"...","confidence":N,"source":"observed|user-stated|inferred"}'
```

Types: `framework` (preferred appraisal framework), `parameter` (custom overrides), `data-source` (preferred data), `output` (past report references), `operational` (tool/env quirks), `preference` (formatting/style). Confidence: 9-10 observed/stated, 6-8 strong inference, 4-5 weak. User-stated never decays; observed/inferred lose 1 point per 30 days. All data stored locally. Nothing transmitted.
